# Transfer_learning_ResNet50_With_Tensorboard
Transfer learning refers to the technique of using knowledge of one domain to another domain .i.e. a NN model trained on one dataset can be used for other dataset by fine-tuning the former network.

# Model has been Trained as a classifier 
I have changed the last layer of the ResNet50 model as we have only 4 categories as compared to ImageNet that has 1000 categories.

#Dataset: Data file is provided as zip file along with ipynb file

TensorBoard has been used in this code for better Visualization of Epoch accuracy, loss vs No. of Epochs. It is an effective callback method from Keras. Results have been included in both ipnb and doc file.
